I am a December 2019 graduate from the University of Manchester with a Master of Research (MRes) degree in Psychology. My interests include psychosis and youth mental health research, data science and qualitative methodologies.

Currently, I am working as a mental health community therapist in a psychiatric rehab centre just outside Oslo, with clients who experience symptoms of psychosis, anxiety, depression and other emotional difficulties. On my spare time I conduct data analyses and data visualisations on open datasets, by using R Studio and R Markdown.

I have experience with qualitative and quantitative methodologies. For my master dissertation I completed an in-depth contextualist thematic analysis where I interviewed students in a school about their experiences of a novel therapy called the Take Control Course. During my MRes, I excelled in the Advanced Statistics and Advanced Statistics Workshop modules where I achieved the highest grade.
